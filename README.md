# Combine_Pics2PDF<br /> 

To run this script, please provide a directory path as a command line argument, copy the path to your clipboard, or put the pictures to merge in the same folder as the script.<br /> 
        

This script converts all image files in a specified directory to a single PDF file. It first checks if a directory path is provided as a command line argument, copied to the clipboard, or the current script directory has pictures. If not, it displays an error message and exits the script. It then loops through all image files in the directory and checks if they are in jpeg, jpg, or png format. It  adds a new page to the PDF for each image, It resizes the image to fit within the page size while maintaining aspect ratio, and centers the image on the page. Finally, it creates the full path of the output file and saves the PDF to that location.
<br /> 
Requirements: FPDF, Pyperclip, PIL
